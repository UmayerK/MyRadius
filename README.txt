Philosophy: 
The pricing algorithm at the heart of the Radius platform is designed to reflect a sophisticated approach to demand-based pricing and cost efficiency optimization. 
It's built on the principle of providing flexibility and scalability, addressing the varying needs of both the factories and the clients. 
By dynamically adjusting the price per item based on the quantity ordered, the algorithm encourages clients to order optimal quantities that leverage economies of scale, effectively reducing the per-unit cost as the order size increases. 
This is particularly beneficial in scenarios where the marginal cost of producing additional units is relatively low, allowing clients to maximize their order value without significantly impacting production costs.
Furthermore, the algorithm incorporates regional production capabilities and economic factors, enabling it to tailor prices not only based on order size but also on the specific capabilities and operational costs of each factory. 
This geo-specific pricing strategy ensures that factories are compensated fairly based on their geographical and economic context, fostering a more equitable distribution network.
By using AI and machine learning techniques, the algorithm continuously learns from order histories, production outcomes, and market trends, refining its pricing models to better predict and respond to the complex interplay of supply and demand. 
This ongoing learning process enhances the platform's ability to offer competitive yet profitable pricing, ensuring long-term sustainability and client satisfaction.
